								<h3>Purpose</h3>
								<p>In Part 2 of this guide, we recieved the number of likes that our contest post recieved. On its own, this information is essentially useless. What we really want is the name and user ID of each user who liked the post, so that we can name a winner from the pool of participants. Now that we have the number of likes, we can utilize that value in a for-loop to display a comprehensive list of participants.
								
								<h3>How To Display A List Of Participants</h3>
								<p>There is no need to perform a separate API call to perform this task. Instead we can update our existing API call to not only display <font color="purple">response.data.length</font>, but also print a list of participants names and ID's to the browser.</p>
								<p>The data object sent back from the API is an array of users who liked our post, therefore we can access the name and id of a user using <font color="purple">response.data[n].name</font> and <font color="purple">response.data[n].id</font> respectively (where n denotes the user's position in the array). By looping through the entire array and displaying each name/ID as we go, we can create a comprehensive list of participants. The following code contains the addition of the for-loop:</p>
								<center><iframe width="100%" height="300" src="http://jsfiddle.net/cmerrill314/9wbg9hvu/embedded/js,html,css,result/dark/" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe></center>
								<p>(Note: The "Result" tab in the above code is only to demonstrate the layout. The AJAX call won't work through JSFiddle, you must run the code through the browser)</p>
								
								<h3>The Final Product</h3>
								<p>This will be the result of running the above code:</p>
								<center><img src="images/results2.jpg" alt="" /></center>
								<p>The user will be able to enter their own Post ID and Access Token. After clicking "Submit", the number of likes will be populated as well as a list of users who liked the post.</p>
								<p>Now that we have our list of participants we will want to check their contest eligibilty (eligible participants are users who liked both the post AND the page). This is outlined in Part 4</p>
